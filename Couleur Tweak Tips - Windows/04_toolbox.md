CTT Toolbox

**Give yourself a headstart when setting up Windows**

The toolbox has been made with the intent of making it easier to tweak Windows and it's settings, quickly install & configure programs. It consists of a bunch of scripts (such as #📝｜tweaklist or #📥｜post-installer) as well as shortcuts/links to make your life easier, whether you're a newbie or a veteran.

:Download: You can download it here: <https://github.com/couleurm/couleurstoolbox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>
*Also feel free to chuck it on a USB stick you're reinstalling Windows with.*
