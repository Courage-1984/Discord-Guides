# debloating script

There's not really much you can do to optimize your computer, most of the known tweaks makes very little to no difference. What matters the most is to use the right settings in-game and to overclock your computer correctly.

If you __encounter a problem__ create an __issue__ on their respective :gh: __GitHub__ repository, NOT in the #🙋⠂support #📥｜old-support channel.

If you're in that "more tweaks = better" mindset (:WeirdChamp:) , this open-source script is for you, it's got most of the "youtuber tweaks" you find in tutorials, but automated.
