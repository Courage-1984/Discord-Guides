# debloating script

There's not really much you can do to optimize your computer, most of the known tweaks makes very little to no difference. What matters the most is to use the right settings in-game and to overclock your computer correctly.

If you __encounter a problem__ create an __issue__ on their respective :gh: __GitHub__ repository, NOT in the #üôã‚†Çsupport #üì•ÔΩúold-support channel.

> :batch: **POST TWEAKS**

If you're in that "more tweaks = better" mindset (:WeirdChamp:) , this open-source script is for you, it's got most of the "youtuber tweaks" you find in tutorials, but automated.

> :CTT: **Chris Titus' Windows Utility [V2]**

A PowerShell toolbox with an installer (uses Winget, use #üì•ÔΩúpost-installer if you prefer Scoop), and some very sane recommended settings, I'd recommend this over Post Tweaks (unless you're living on the edge)
